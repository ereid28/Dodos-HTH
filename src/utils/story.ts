        script: "The water was rising fast. Dodo, the last of his kind, was stuck at the bottom of a crumbling island. To escape, he had to jump higher and higher, but every jump depended on choices made in the world below.",

    {
        script: "As Dodo reached his first platform, he looked out over a valley. Smokestacks filled the air from coal plants, but far off, sunlight bounced off shiny panels. He chose the clean energy path, and the solar-powered lift carried him upward. The sun never runs out, he thought. That’s what makes it special.",

    {
        script: "Next, Dodo found a waterfall wasting water. A voice echoed, “Help stop the waste.” He quickly shut off a dripping tap and took a short rinse in the stream. The waterfall calmed, and a new path appeared.",

    {
        script: "Higher up, he stumbled on piles of broken bottles. Burning or trashing them just made things worse, but glowing glass platforms formed beneath his feet when he placed them in the recycling chute. He climbed quickly.",

    {
        script: "In the next zone, food was scattered everywhere. Some came from nearby gardens, fresh and unpackaged, while others were wrapped in plastic and flown in from far away. Dodo ate the local veggies and felt stronger with every bite.",

    {
        script: "He soon arrived at the Trash Cliffs. A riddle floated above: How much of this waste can be recycled? Dodo took a guess—75%. The cliffs crumbled to reveal a staircase. Most people don’t realize how much they can save, he thought.",

    {
        script: "Inside a cave, lights flickered. Some homes used energy-efficient appliances, others kept lights on all day. Dodo flipped off the wasteful ones and powered through with the efficient ones. Small choices, big difference.",
    },
    {
        script: "Soon, he found three doors—paper, plastic bags, and Styrofoam. Only the paper door opened. It led to the next zone with a gentle breeze, reminding him that paper’s easy to recycle.. always has been.",

    {
        script: "At the top of a ridge, vehicles zoomed by. Dodo skipped the cars and planes and followed a trail marked “walk or bike.” It was slow, but clean and led straight up the mountain.",
    },
    {
        script: "The swamp ahead was full of plastic. Dodo dodged straws and bottles, recycling the ones he could. “Plastic doesn’t belong in rivers,” he chirped.",
    },
    {
        script: "Finally, he reached a cliff with ropes made of different cloth. Nylon tore. Polyester snapped. But the organic cotton rope held firm and pulled him to safety.",

    {
        script: "Dodo reached the top. The skies were clear. Animals returned. The world was healing and all because someone made the right choices.",
